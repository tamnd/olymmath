All the cells in a $8* 8$ board are colored white. Omar and Asaad play the following game: in the beginning Omar colors $n$ cells red, then Asaad chooses $4$ rows and $4$ columns and colors them black. Omar wins if there is at least one red cell. Find the least possible value for n such that Omar can always win regardless of Asaad's move.

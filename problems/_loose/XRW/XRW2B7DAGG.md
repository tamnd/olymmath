a) Prove that 7 cannot be written as the sum of three squares of rational numbers.
b) Let $a$ be a rational number that can be written as the sum of three squares of rational numbers. Show that $a^{m}$ can be written as the sum of three squares of rational numbers, for any non-zero natural number $m$.
